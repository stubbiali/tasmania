The tests rely on `conf.py` and `utils.py`. To create a soft link to these two modules
in any subdirectory:

    . prepare_tests.sh
    
To generate the baseline images needed by the Matplotlib tests in `plot/`:
    
    . prepare_matplotlib.sh
    
To run the entire test suite:

    pytest
    
To run only the tests contained in a subfolder:

    pytest <subfolder>
    
To run a specific test, *do not* enter the corresponding subfolder. Rather, from
this directory issue

    pytest <subfolder>/<test>
    
A makefile is provided to automate all these tasks:

  - `make clean` deletes all the temporary and auxiliary files;
  - `make gtclean` invokes `make clean` and deletes all the code generated by GT4Py;
  - `make distclean` invokes `make gtclean` and deletes the baseline and result images;
  - `make prepare` prepares the tests;
  - `make run` runs the test suite;
  - `make all` deletes all the temporary and auxiliary files, and prepares and runs
    all the tests.

**Tasmania** is a Python package for the numerical modeling of the atmosphere.
Its goal is two-fold:

* Extend and enrich the `Sympl <https://sympl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
  toolkit for writing flexible, modular and maintainable Earth System models;
* Probe the suitability of a Python-based development environment for
  performance-portable weather applications.

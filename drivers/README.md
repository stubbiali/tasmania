This folder contains the scripts to simulate two benchmark test cases for the 
Burgers' equations (`burgers/`) and the isentropic model (`isentropic/`).

The scripts are named `driver_namelist_{suffix}.py`. The suffix `{suffix}` denotes 
the physics-dynamics coupling strategy which is used:

  - `fc` for the full-coupling method;
  - `lfc` for the *lazy* full-coupling method;
  - `ps` for the parallel splitting method;
  - `sts` for the sequential-tendency splitting method;
  - `sus` for the sequential-update splitting method;
  - `ssus` for the symmetrized sequential-update (or Strang) splitting method.
  
The user can modify the settings of the driver by editing the associated namelist
file `namelist_{suffix}.py`. Some of the most useful namelist variables are: 

  - `gt_kwargs`: dictionary collecting all GT4Py configs (e.g. backend, dtype,
    default origin);
  - `domain_x`, `domain_y`: domain boundaries along the two horizontal dimensions;
  - `nx`, `ny`: number of grid points along the two horizontal dimensions;
  - `domain_z` (only for the Burgers' model): domain boundaries along the vertical
    direction;
  - `nz` (only for the isentropic model): number of model vertical levels;
  - `timestep`: model timestep;
  - `niter`: number of time iterations to perform;
  - `save`: `True` to dump the solution into the NetCDF file `filename` every 
    `save_frequency` iterations. If `save_frequency` is negative, only the first
    and last iteration are saved;
  - `print_frequency`: set the frequency of printing insightful diagnostics to screen;
    if negative, information is printed only at the end of the last iteration.
    
To run a driver using the associated namelist, enter the corresponding folder and issue

    python driver_namelist_{suffix}.py
    
For the isentropic model, the namelist can be specified as command-line argument:

    python <driver> -n <namelist> 
    
For `driver_namelist_{suffix}.py`, `<namelist>` defaults to `namelist_{suffix}.py`.
    
To compare two solutions (e.g. solutions computed using two different backends),
one could use the `compare_solutions.py` script in the `{REPO_ROOT}/scripts/python/` 
folder.

To delete all the temporary and auxiliary files:

    make clean
    
In addition, to delete all the code generated by GT4Py:

    make distclean
